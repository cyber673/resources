ATTACK VECTOR ANALYSIS:
- Initial access: Phishing email with malicious PDF attachment sent to nurul@devbytes.bn
- PDF contained macro that executed PowerShell script to establish backdoor connection
- Attacker used compromised credentials to access admin portal
- Evidence shows attacker attempted to export customer database

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
- Systems affected: Admin portal, customer database
- Data potentially exposed: Addresses for approximately 1,500 users
- Service disruption: 45 minutes of downtime due to emergency shutdown
- No evidence of data modification or destruction

RESPONSE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Terminated malicious processes and connections
2. Disabled compromised account
3. Analyzed logs to determine scope
4. Restored database from backup (note: backup not verified before restoration)
5. Changed all admin passwords
6. Restored services after verification

COMMUNICATION ACTIONS:
- Internal team notified via Slack
- No notification sent to customers
- No report filed with BruCERT
- No documentation of decision not to report

POST-INCIDENT ANALYSIS:
- Root cause: Successful phishing attack + lack of MFA on admin portal
- Contributing factors:
  * Users had ability to download and open attachments from any email
  * No security awareness training conducted in past 6 months
  * Admin portal accessible from public internet without IP restrictions
  * Excessive permissions for regular user accounts
  * Backup restoration procedure lacked proper verification step

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement MFA for all administrative access
2. Conduct phishing awareness training for all staff
3. Restrict admin portal access to office IP range
4. Improve email scanning/filtering
5. Review and restrict user permissions
6. Improve incident response coordination
7. Verify backup integrity before restoration
8. Create formal procedure for security incident reporting to authorities
